# HTML5 Shoot 'em Up Game

Originally forked from [Bryan Bibat's repository](https://github.com/bryanbibat/html5shmup-template.git), this version now includes a few extra aircraft sprites and a sound toggle (off by default).

The original author of this repo has an excellent book on Lean Pub about how this game was built. You can check it out here: [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon)
